        Hello there and welcome to my personal blog. I thought this might be a good place to show some of my projects and knowledge. I'm a computer science student who really likes machine learning, mostly because it's creative, it's intercepted with many other fileds like biology, chemistry, mechanics, etc. It's usefull and helpful on a global level and I personally believe that the future of machine learning and artificial intelligience is yet to come. I'm pursuing this exciting field but I'm also interested in mathematics, algorithms, cryptography, Linux and so on.
        <br> <br>
        I've decided to create every note as a complete, independent story which reprsesents summary of my knowleage with resources for further reading. In the resources there are links to lectures created by professionals, which I used for learning. I'm not able to dedicate too much time to writing and rechecking everything, so there is a chance that some errors and inconsistency occur. Also note that I'm not proving anything formally :-).
        <br> <br>
        In the projects section I list my projects that are related to machine learning. I'm currently working on a few deep learning projects and they are in the training or code refactoring stage and I'll publish them soon as possible.
        <br> <br>
        If you have any suggestions or questions that you may want to ask me, feel free to email me at <a href="#"> mcerovic.blog@gmail.com</a>.
